Jai Prakash .M.D | Med-Tech Portfolio

A highly interactive 3D portfolio that bridges the gap between Medicine and Server Engineering, powered by Three.js and Gemini AI.

🚀 Live Demo Features https://jaiprakashmd18.github.io/3d

Bio-Synthetic DNA Engine: A fully 3D, rotating DNA helix with light-reactive crystal geometry.

AI Nexus Terminal: A functional chat interface that acts as a "Code Pathologist" and "Medical Translator".

Holographic Certificates: Interactive 3D tilt cards for credentials.

🛠️ Setup for GitHub Pages

To keep your API key secure, the index.html file in this repository has the API Key field empty by default. This ensures your key is never stolen by bots scanning GitHub.

How to Enable Live AI (For You)

Deploy: Upload index.html and career.html to your GitHub repository and enable GitHub Pages.

Visit: Go to your live website URL (e.g., jaiprakash.github.io).

Unlock:

Scroll down to the AI_NEXUS terminal.

Type the following command and hit Enter:

set_key YOUR_REAL_API_KEY_HERE


The site will save the key to your browser's Secure Local Storage and reload.

The AI will now be LIVE for you on that device!

How it Works for Visitors

Visitors who do not have your key will see the "Simulation Mode".

They can still interact with the terminal.

They will receive pre-written, witty "Demo" responses (e.g., comparing a server crash to cardiac arrest).

This ensures the site always looks broken-free and impressive, even without a live key.

📦 Files

index.html: Main portfolio file with 3D engine and AI logic.

career.html: A detailed timeline of your education and career.

🔧 Customization

DNA Colors: Edit the --medical-cyan and --server-green variables in the CSS.

AI Personality: Modify the protocols object in the JavaScript section of index.html.
